However, the fact remains that surveillance does not reduce crime and only further criminalizes those same communities. Eye on Surveillance is a group of community members and organizations working together under three points of unity:\n\n1. Halt the local governmentâ€™s expansion of surveillance tools such as facial recognition and social media monitoring and increase oversight of current government surveillance methods.\n2. Explore evidence-based anti surveillance options for public safety through  community input in the form of increased oversight of current government surveillance methods\n3. Protection of vulnerable communities. Protect vulnerable communities from potential harm associated with government surveillance."}},"profile":{"title":"Eye on Surveillance","image":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/lp7vq2grdldw/4ZdFHRqzSt0uB33MSsQyT3/825f800611e844583ae5d3849958b3b5/logo.jpg?w=450&fl=progressive&q=100"}}}}}
